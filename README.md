# vehicle managenent system in Java
this is a Java-based object-oriented programming project that models a basic vehicle management system. it includes different types of vehicles (`Car` and `Bike`), simulating behaviors like refueling and running, while demonstrating principles of inheritance and polymorphism.

##  features
- **inheritance and polymorphism**: `Car` and `Bike` extend the base `Vehicle` class and override its methods
- **gas consumption Simulation**: `Car` objects consume and track fuel over time; `Bike` objects do not use fuel
- **encapsulation**: key attributes and behaviors are encapsulated using `protected` access modifiers and getter methods
- **custom `equals()` and `toString()`**: override implementations to compare and display vehicles meaningfully
- **JUnit testing**: comprehensive unit tests using JUnit 5 to ensure correct behavior

##  testing
Includes a full test suite `VehicleTest.java` with:
- brand/type validation
- age calculation
- fuel refueling logic
- total fuel consumption tracking
- equality checks and string representation

this project was an assignment for MOOC: Inheritance and Data Structure in Java course that is basen on Coursera platform. after almost 12 hours of fighting against errors i scored **100/100** on automated grading tests!

## 📁 project structure
src/ ├── transportation/ │ ├── Vehicle.java │ ├── Car.java │ ├── Bike.java │ └── VehicleFullTest.java

## what i learnt

- hands-on practice with OOP principles in Java
- proper use of method overriding
- writing maintainable and testable code
- writing and organizing JUnit tests effectively
